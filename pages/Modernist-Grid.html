					<p>Printing until the middle of the twentieth century was mainly letterpress, from inked type and photoengravings. The piece of metal which carried the inked letter was rectangular. These rectangles increased in height with the size of the letter in ﬁxed increments, so that moveable, reusable type has been described as a modular, standardised system.</p>

					<p>The printing trade had the habit of ﬁlling out the lines of type with space between the words so that the reader came to expect a textured, rectangular panel of text on the page. The lines were separated horizontally by ﬁxed amounts, packed out with thin strips of lead ~ hence leading. The distance between one line and the next appeared as a constant line of white paper. This rectangularity was essential to the mechanical process. (By tightening wedges, the rectangular type and spacing material could be locked in position in a metal frame. This allowed it to be moved from the bench where it was assembled to the bed of a printing press.)</p>
					
					<p>The essential elements of the grid — rectangularity, standardisation and modules, repetition and separation — are all present in pre-Modernist typographic design. The distance between the printed area and the edge of the paper — the margins — were outside this modular system.</p>
					
					<p>In twentieth century typographic practice, the grid developed as a means of reducing the number of choices that the designer could make about dimensions of columns and illustrations. Instructions to the printer could be simpler by reference to a ﬁxed and limited set of measurements.</p>
					
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							<q>Tell me, are you a Gridnik?</q>
						</p>
					</blockquote>

					<p>This was the opening question put to me by a distinguished Central European designer. He was inspecting an English art school, and his probing was hostile. The grid was seen as an inhuman weapon used by the young to destroy the graphic whimsy of the old guard.</p>
					
					<p>This was in the early 1960s. Serious young typographers had been taken with the Swiss architect Le Corbusier’s Modulor system of proportions. Students were aware of Jan Tschichold’s scholarly analyses of page proportions. The Modulor, however, could be applied not only to divisions of the printed sheet, but also to divisions within the print area. This system was one of relationships of size — the determinants of proportion.</p>
					
					<p>The concept of proportion implies aesthetics. In the visual culture of Modernism, aesthetics and function were, ideally, reconciled. The work of stereotype ﬁgures of this culture — of the painter Mondrian and the architect Mies - suggests something about the grid. Horizontal and vertical lines divide the painter’s canvases and the architect’s façades — deﬁning Mondrian’s panels of ﬂat colour and Mies’ rectangles of glass or cladding. It is an image of rectangularity.</p>
					
					<p>Yet, in relation to the grid in print design, the examples of Mondrian and Mies are deceptive, but at the same time instructive. It is only its rectangularity that connects Mondrian’s work with the grid: its relationships, the width of its lines and the areas of its planes are arrived at intuitively, by experiment. It provided a formal language: its function was purely aesthetic.</p>
					
					<p>Mies' buildings are more relevant to the grid. The design of a modern façade is partly determined by the building’s structure. And in addition to their rectangularity, they use repeated dimensions. But the vertical lines that the architect emphasises for aesthetic reasons are a result of structural demands, of making the building stand up. The word ‘structure’ is often applied loosely in discussing two-dimensional design, when it is referring to solely aesthetic judgements. The structure of a sensible grid is the outcome of the information to be organised within it.</p>
					
					<p>Within the Modern Movement in Europe in the twentieth century, between the two World Wars, progressive architecture and graphic design were closely related. But the concept of standardisation, of the repetition and combination of standard size elements, was a special concern. In building, as in typography, this was a matter of organising machine-produced parts: in architecture of joining those parts, and in printing of ﬁtting them together (individual letters in a word) but more often of separating them (words, lines, columns and pages). In building, there is a structural member or a joint. In print, there is a white space.</p>
